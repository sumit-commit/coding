-> Each Node is connected with its previous and its next node.

-> In this, each node contains threefields:-

(i)   - *prev - for storing address of previous node	
(ii)  - datafield - for storing data
(iii) - *next -  for storing address of next node


-> It is similar to doubly linked list, with two extra properties:

   (i)  - *prev field of head contains address of last node
   (ii) - * next field of tail contains address of head node


class node{
    public:

   all Functions on the basis of Algorithms given below

};


Algorithms :-

1) TRAVERSING ALL NODES :-

    if(head == NULL)
        {
          cout<<"List is Empty nothing to traverse";
        }
        else
        {
           node* tmp= head;
           while(tmp->next!=head)
           {
               cout<<tmp->data<<" ";
               tmp = tmp->next;
           }
	   cout<<tmp->data;
        }



2) INSERT NODE AT FIRST POSITION :-

        node* ptr =  new node(val);
	
        if (head == NULL)
        {
	    head = ptr;
	    tail = ptr;
            head->prev = tail;
	    tail->next = head;
        }
        else
        {
	    ptr->next = head;
 	    head->prev = ptr;
 	    head = ptr;
            head->prev = tail;
	    tail->next = head;
        }
	length++;


3)  INSERT NODE AT LAST POSITION :-

	node* ptr = new node(val);

        if(head == NULL)
        {
            head = ptr;
            tail = ptr;
            head->prev = tail;
            tail->next = head;
        }
        else
        {
            tail->next = ptr;
            ptr->prev = tail;
            tail = ptr;
            head->prev = tail;
            tail->next = head;
           
        }
	length++;


4) INSERT NODE AT SOME POSITION

   if(position<2)
        {
            2) INSERT NODE AT FIRST POSITION
        }
        else if(position>length)
        {
            3)  INSERT NODE AT LAST POSITION 
        }
        else
        {
            node* temp = head;
            node* ptr= new node(val);
            while(pos>2)
            {
                temp = temp->next;
                pos--;
            }
            
            
            ptr>next = temp->next;
            temp->next->prev = ptr;
            temp->next = ptr;
            ptr>prev = temp;
   	    length++;
        }



5) DELETE NODE FROM FIRST POSITION

     if(head == NULL)
        {
            cout<<"Linked List is Empty\n";
        }
        else if(head == tail)
        {
            head = NULL;
	    tail = NULL;
            length--;
        }
	else
	{
	    head = head->next;
            head->prev = tail;
 	    tail->next = head;
            length--;
        }



6) DELETE NODE FROM LAST POSITION

      if(head == NULL)
        {
            cout<<"Linked List is Empty\n";
        }
	else if(head == tail)
	{	
	    head = NULL;
	    tail = NULL;
	    length--;
	}
        else
        {
            tail = tail->prev;
            head->prev = tail;
            tail->next = head;
            length--;
        }


7) DELETE FROM SOME POSITION
   
   if(position<2)
        {
            DELETE FROM FIRST POSITION
        }
        else if(position>=length)
        {
            DELETE FROM LAST POSITION
        }
        else
        {
            node* ptr = head;
            
            while(position>2)
            {
                ptr = ptr->next;
                position--;
            }
      
            ptr->next = ptr->next->next;
	    ptr->next->next->prev = ptr
            length--;  
        }
